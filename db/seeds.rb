# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Room.create(:name => 'marker_sinanbil', :marker => "36.768795, 127.282470", :title => '신안빌', :structure => "9평(방1, 화장실1)", :period => '6', :payment => '200', :fee => '20', :deposit => '30', :phone_num => '010-5353-0189')
